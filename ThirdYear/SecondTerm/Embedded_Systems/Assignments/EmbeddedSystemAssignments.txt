1- when every algorithms is useful
• FF (first fit) algorithm, where the list is scanned from the beginning for the 
first “hole” that is large enough.

• NF (next fit) where the list is scanned from where the last search ended for 
the next “hole” that is large enough.

• BF (best fit) where the entire list is searched for the hole that best fits the 
new data.

• WF (worst fit), which places data in the largest available “hole.”

• QF (quick fit) where a list is kept of memory sizes and allocation is done from 
this information.

DONE :D

2- Petri For the problem of midterm.
- One producer and two consumers.
- Not alternating.
- they work on condition.
- one of them produces double tokens of the other. 
- if they work together the producer should generate enough token for both of them. 


- 3 Scenarios
 1. first plant only will be water.
 2. second plant only will be water.
 3. both want to be planted.

- Try to use PIPE
